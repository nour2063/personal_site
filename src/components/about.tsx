                As a software developer currently pursuing a Masterâ€™s degree at the University of Glasgow,
                I am building a holistic perspective on computing by exploring a wide range of technical subjects.

                My recent work has been centred on extended reality and spatial computing, which I believe will become
                the fundamental medium for future user experiences. I am driven by the conviction that nearly any
                concept involving a user and a computer can be translated into a richer, more intuitive 3D interaction.

                My personal background has prepared me well for this dynamic field. Born in Egypt and raised across
                Saudi Arabia, England, Qatar, and the UAE before moving to Scotland, I thrive in multicultural and
                fast-paced settings. This global upbringing has made me inherently adaptable and excited for the next
                challenge, wherever it may be.

                I'm a pretty outdoorsy guy. My hobbies include running, cycling, hiking, and climbing. When it's cold
                outside though you'd find me in the kitchen baking cookies instead. I love video games, especially ones
                that have a unique gimmick or interaction, and controversial movies I can debate over with my friends
                for hours.
